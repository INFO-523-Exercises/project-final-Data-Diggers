# Seeing the Unseen: Predicting Brain Stroke

## Dataset Description

::: {.incremental width="40%"}
-   The [Brain Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset) is taken from Kaggle datasets and consists of 4982 rows and 11 columns.
-   Gender, age, hypertension, average glucose level, smoking status, stroke
:::

## Smoking Status and Age relation

## Disease and Strokes

## Question 1 : How accurate are various classification models for detecting a stroke in a patient?

::: incremental
Approach

-   In the initial phase of our brain stroke prediction project, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the dataset. The **brain.shape** and **brain.info()** checks ensured the dataset's integrity, revealing its dimensions and basic information.
:::

## Classification models used:

::: nonincremental
-   **Logistic Regression**

    In stroke prediction, logistic regression is employed to estimate the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on given features, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between various factors and stroke risk.

-   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

    KNN is employed to identify patterns by assessing the similarity of instances, contributing to the assessment of stroke risk based on feature patterns.

-   **Naive Bayes**

    Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that models the probability of stroke occurrence based on given features, assuming a Gaussian distribution for continuous features and feature independence.

-   **Decision Tree**

    Decision trees are valuable for identifying key features and their interactions that contribute to predicting the likelihood of strokes.

-   **Random Forest**

    In stroke prediction, Random Forests are employed to capture complex relationships within the dataset by aggregating predictions from multiple decision trees, providing a robust approach to assess stroke risk.

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

## Feeling adventurous ! t?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
