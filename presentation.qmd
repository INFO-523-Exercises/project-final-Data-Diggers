## Dataset Description

::: {.incremental width="40%"}
-   The [Brain Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset) is taken from Kaggle datasets and consists of 4982 rows and 11 columns.
-   Gender, age, hypertension, average glucose level, smoking status, stroke
:::

## EDA Plots

-   Gender

-   Smoking status and age relation

-   Age vs average glucose level

-   Heart disease and strokes

-   Correlation Heat Map

## Heart Disease and Strokes

## Correlation Heat Map

-   This heatmap is useful for identifying potential patterns and relationships between different numeric variables in the dataset.

## Question 1 : How accurate are various classification models for detecting a stroke in a patient?

::: incremental
Approach

-   In the initial phase of our brain stroke prediction project, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the dataset. The **brain.shape** and **brain.info()** checks ensured the dataset's integrity, revealing its dimensions and basic information.
:::

## Classification models used:

::: nonincremental
-   **Logistic Regression**

-   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

-   **Naive Bayes**

-   **Decision Tree**

-   **Random Forest**

## Model Accuracy Results

## Selected Model:

### Logistic Regression

-   Accuracy - 95%

## Question 2: How are certain lifestyle changes ranked on the basis of their importance in reducing the possibility of a stroke? {.smaller}

::: incremental
Approach

-   The feature ranking provided by the logistic regression model with their corresponding coefficients gives insights into the impact of each feature on the likelihood of the target variable.
:::

## Feature ranking :

| Feature           | Coefficient |
|-------------------|-------------|
| age_band          | 1.187519    |
| avg_glucose_level | 0.880860    |
| hypertension      | 0.551390    |
| heart_diesease    | 0.288187    |
| gender            | 0.073007    |
| smoking_status    | -0.053451   |
| bmi               | -0.211967   |

## Here's an interpretation of the feature ranking :

::: incremental
-   Age is a big factor in stroke and has a positive coefficient above 1.

-   Average glucose level is the second most significant feature with a coefficient of 0.88

-   BMI coefficient is -0.21. Higher BMI is associated with lower likelihood of the target variable.
:::

## Challenges faced

::: incremental
-   Class imbalance where one class (e.g stroke) significantly outnumbers the other, chances of leading to biased models

-   Choosing an appropriate model that balances complexity and interpretability
