# Seeing the Unseen: Predicting Brain Stroke

## Dataset Description

::: {.incremental width="40%"}
-   The [Brain Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset) is taken from Kaggle datasets and consists of 4982 rows and 11 columns.
-   Gender, age, hypertension, average glucose level, smoking status, stroke

## Question 1 : How accurate are various classification models for detecting a stroke in a patient?

::: incremental
Approach

-   In the initial phase of our brain stroke prediction project, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the dataset. The **brain.shape** and **brain.info()** checks ensured the dataset's integrity, revealing its dimensions and basic information.
:::

## Classification models used:

::: nonincremental
-   **Logistic Regression**

    In stroke prediction, logistic regression is employed to estimate the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on given features, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between various factors and stroke risk.

-   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

    KNN is employed to identify patterns by assessing the similarity of instances, contributing to the assessment of stroke risk based on feature patterns.

-   **Naive Bayes**

    Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that models the probability of stroke occurrence based on given features, assuming a Gaussian distribution for continuous features and feature independence.

-   **Decision Tree**

    Decision trees are valuable for identifying key features and their interactions that contribute to predicting the likelihood of strokes.

-   **Random Forest**

    In stroke prediction, Random Forests are employed to capture complex relationships within the dataset by aggregating predictions from multiple decision trees, providing a robust approach to assess stroke risk.

## Question 2: {.smaller}

```         
How are certain lifestyle changes ranked on the basis of their importance in reducing the possibility of a stroke?
```

The feature ranking provided by the logistic regression model with their corresponding coefficients gives insights into the impact of each feature on the likelihood of the target variable. In logistic regression, the coefficients represent the change in the log-odds of the target variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding feature.

The feature ranking provided by the logistic regression model with their corresponding coefficients gives insights into the impact of each feature on the likelihood of the target variable. In logistic regression, the coefficients represent the change in the log-odds of the target variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding feature.

Here's an interpretation of the feature ranking :

1)age_band (Coefficient: 1.187519):

For every one-unit increase in the age_band, the log-odds of the target variable increase by approximately 1.187519. Older age is associated with a higher likelihood of the target variable.

2)avg_glucose_level (Coefficient: 0.880860):

For every one-unit increase in avg_glucose_level, the log-odds of the target variable increase by approximately 0.880860. Higher average glucose levels are associated with a higher likelihood of the target variable.

3)hypertension (Coefficient: 0.551390):

Individuals with hypertension have a log-odds of the target variable approximately 0.551390 higher than those without hypertension. Hypertension is associated with a higher likelihood of the target variable.

4)heart_disease (Coefficient: 0.288187):

Individuals with heart disease have a log-odds of the target variable approximately 0.288187 higher than those without heart disease. Heart disease is associated with a higher likelihood of the target variable.

5)gender (Coefficient: 0.073007):

Being of the male gender is associated with a log-odds of the target variable approximately 0.073007 higher than being of the female gender. Gender has a positive but relatively small association with the likelihood of the target variable.

6)smoking_status (Coefficient: -0.053451):

For every one-unit increase in smoking_status, the log-odds of the target variable decrease by approximately 0.053451. Smoking is associated with a lower likelihood of the target variable.

7)bmi (Coefficient: -0.211967):

For every one-unit increase in BMI, the log-odds of the target variable decrease by approximately 0.211967. Higher BMI is associated with a lower likelihood of the target variable.

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

## Feeling adventuroust?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
