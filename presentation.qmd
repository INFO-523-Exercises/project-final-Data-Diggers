# Seeing the Unseen: Predicting Brain Stroke

## Dataset Description

::: {.incremental width="40%"}

## Question 1 : How accurate are various classification models for detecting a stroke in a patient?

::: incremental
Approach

-   In the initial phase of our brain stroke prediction project, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the dataset. The **brain.shape** and **brain.info()** checks ensured the dataset's integrity, revealing its dimensions and basic information.
:::

## Classification models used:

::: nonincremental
-   **Logistic Regression**

    In stroke prediction, logistic regression is employed to estimate the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on given features, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between various factors and stroke risk.

-   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

    KNN is employed to identify patterns by assessing the similarity of instances, contributing to the assessment of stroke risk based on feature patterns.

-   **Naive Bayes**

    Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that models the probability of stroke occurrence based on given features, assuming a Gaussian distribution for continuous features and feature independence.

-   **Decision Tree**

    Decision trees are valuable for identifying key features and their interactions that contribute to predicting the likelihood of strokes.

-   **Random Forest**

    In stroke prediction, Random Forests are employed to capture complex relationships within the dataset by aggregating predictions from multiple decision trees, providing a robust approach to assess stroke risk.

## Question 2: How are certain lifestyle changes ranked on the basis of their importance in reducing the possibility of a stroke? {.smaller}

::: incremental
Approach

-   The feature ranking provided by the logistic regression model with their corresponding coefficients gives insights into the impact of each feature on the likelihood of the target variable.

## Here's an interpretation of the feature ranking :

+----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1)age_band (Coefficient: 1.187519):          | For every one-unit increase in the age_band, the log-odds of the target variable increase by approximately 1.187519. Older age is associated with a higher likelihood of the target variable.                                                   |

## Feeling adventurous??

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
